## CODE:

///

/// multiplies x times y

///

def multiply(x, y):

total = 0

while x > 0:

total += y

x -= 1

return total

## Answer

- What is wrong with the above code?

  looping x time and increment every step with y

- If you find it wrong, please fix the code above without using the “\*” or “/” operator or Absolute call?

  ```
  def multiply(x, y):
    total = 0
    if x<0:
        while x < 0:
            total += y
        x += 1
    elif x>0:
        while x > 0:
            total += y
            x -= 1

    return total

  ```

- As part of our development process we test all methods at a code level. Which input values would you use to do the testing?
  multiply(-5, 5)

- For later discussion: What else worries you as you fix this problem?
