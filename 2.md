Given these two tables:

Table: USA_CUSTOMERS (USA)

| ID  | NAME   |
| --- | ------ |
| 1   | Thomas |
| 3   | Cindy  |

Table: EU_CUSTOMERS (EU)

| ID  | NAME     |
| --- | -------- |
| 2   | Francois |
| 1   | Thomas   |

What would be the output of the following select statements?

## Answer

Select USA.NAME, EU.NAME From USA, EU Where USA.ID = EU.ID

| NAME   |
| ------ |
| Thomas |

Select USA.NAME, EU.NAME From USA left join EU on (USA.ID = EU.ID)

| USA.NAME | EU.NAME |
| -------- | ------- |
| Thomas   | Thomas  |

Select USA.NAME, EU.NAME From USA, EU

| USA.NAME | EU.NAME  |
| -------- | -------- |
| Thomas   |          |
| Cindy    |          |
|          | Francois |

For later discussion: we use those tables to keep track of our European and American customers. Please provide a critique to that table design (is it good? How could it be better?)
